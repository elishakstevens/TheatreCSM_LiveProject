# Theatre CSM Live Project: Rentals

## Introduction
In this live project, I spent two weeks working with my peers on developing a content management service for a Theatre company that was built using ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework. My assignment was to track rentals and their condition utilizing CRUD functionality. I've always been very good at problem-solving and time management, and this live project really tested my abilities, as this was more difficult than I anticipated. Despite this, I managed to get through more stories than the Python Live Project, creating many elements for the first time. I understand how to create a good quality product, and the work that goes into it. I was able to utilize important aspects of being a software developer within a real project, including Version Control, Project Management and Azure DevOps.
